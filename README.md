## Magento 2 Product image zoom extension 

You are selling products on Magento online stores, Magento 2 Product zoom extension will help customers see your products in the clearest and most detailed way.

### Description

When shopping in an online store, the problem that hinders the customer's shopping process is not being able to view product details directly. Understanding this, Magepow developed the Magento 2 Product zoom extension.

This extension allows customers to enlarge product images to see details that they cannot see at normal resolution. 3 zoom types you can use are Window zoom, Inner zoom, and Lens zoom.

- Window zoom: Positioning the window can be done by setting a default position and then using x and y offset to adjust. You can also position the window into a container. The administrator can customize the size of the Zoom window (width, height) and zoom window offset (x-axis, y-axis) in the admin panel.

- Inner Zoom: the zoom can be placed inside of the image

- Lens zoom: You can use the lens zoom setting to "Magnify the image". The image to the least has been constrained so it tucks underneath the image.
